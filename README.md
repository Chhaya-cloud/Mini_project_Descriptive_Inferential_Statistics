# Mini_project_Descriptive_Inferential_Statistics
Project introduces the basics of Descriptive and Inferential Statistics. Students will manually calculate and interpret measures like mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, range, and interquartile range. It also covers confidence intervals and hypothesis testing using real-world examples. 
## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Understand statistical terminology: population, sample, parameters, statistics, and data types
- Calculate and interpret:
  - Measures of Central Tendency (Mean, Median, Mode)
  - Measures of Dispersion (Range, Variance, Standard Deviation, IQR)
- Identify levels of measurement: Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, Ratio
- Compute and interpret Confidence Intervals
- Perform One-sample Hypothesis Testing using Z-Test
- Visualize and summarize data using Boxplots and Five-number summaries
